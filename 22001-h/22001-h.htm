<blockquote><i>The praises of poetry have been often sung in ancient and in
modern times; strange powers have been ascribed to it of influence
over animate and inanimate auditors; its force over fascinated
crowds has been acknowledged; but before Wither, no one ever
celebrated its power at home, the wealth and the strength which
this divine gift confers upon its possessor. Fame, and that too
after death, was all which hitherto the poets had promised themselves
from this art. It seems to have been left to Wither to
discover that poetry was a present possession, as well as a rich
reversion, and that the Muse has a promise of both lives,--of this,
and of that which was to come.</i>--CHARLES LAMB.</blockquote>

<h3 id="pf">Prefatory Note</h3>


<p>There are few issues attended with greater uncertainty
than the fate of a poet, and of the three represented
herein it may be said that they survive but
tardily in public interest. Such a state of things, in
spite of all pleading, is quite beyond reason; hence
the purport of this small Anthology is at once obvious.</p>

<p>A group of poets graced with rarest charm and
linked together by several and varied circumstances,
each one figures here in unique evidence and bold
relief of individuality. They are called of the order
Spenserian; servants at the altar to the Pastoral
Muse; and, in the reckoning of time, belong to that
glorious age of great Elizabeth. Nicholas Breton
(or Britton, as it is pronounced) and William Browne
were both contributors to <i>England's Helicon</i>, of 1614,
and Browne and Wither each submitted verses for
<i>The Shepherd's Pipe</i>, a publication of the same year.
The former two were, in turn, under the patronage of
that most cultured family, the Herberts, Breton being
a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of "Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother,"
whom Browne (and not Ben Jonson, as is commonly
said) eulogised thus in elegy. George Wither, being
Browne's intimate friend, was presumably not unappreciated
by the kinsfolk of George Herbert. Thus
do they appear as in a bond of spiritual union.</p>

<p>Breton, a step-son to the poet Gascoigne, and the
elder of our fascinating trio, is conspicuous for an unswerving,
whole-hearted attachment to nature and
rural scenes. It is in the pastoral lyric where, with
tenderest devotion, he pursues, untrammelled, a light
and free-born fancy. His fertile, varied muse, laden
with the passionate exaggerations of love-lorn swain,
is yet charged with richest imagery and thought, full
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page06" name="page06"></a>{06}</span>
to overflowing with joyous abandonment, and sweet
with the perfume of many flowers, culled in distant
fields.</p>

<p>Wither, though best remembered by exploits in the
political arena, is none the less a poet of deep and
purest feeling. To be sure, his best and earlier work
has all of that delightful extravagance and amorous
colouring peculiar to the age. But there is reflected a
homely dignity and mobile, felicitous vein in which
the poet seems endowed with every attribute of a
melodist. Exquisite, graceful and diverse he, at times,
would soar to flights of highest inspiration and bedeck
the page with gems of rarest worth. In the heptasyllabic
couplet he is decidedly successful.</p>

<p>And lastly William Browne, than whom we have
not a more modest and retiring singer, here makes his
bow with a slender portfolio of excerpts. Whatever
else may transpire it is certain that labour such as his
bears the assurance of unsullied happiness and overflowing
joy. It is quaint, simple, unassuming; without
affectation, full of pathos, and gently sensitive. He
was a man who knew no guile, and his sweet and artless
nature is faithfully portrayed in the outpourings
of an impressionable, poetic soul. To dance with
rustic maidens on the lea; to sing by moonlight to
the piper's strain; to be happy, always happy, such is
the theme, delicate and refined, of these our half-forgotten
poets.</p>

<h3 id="nb02">Aglaia: a Pastoral</h3>
<div class="poem">
<p>Sylvan Muses, can ye sing</p>
<p>Of the beauty of the Spring?</p>
<p>Have ye seen on earth that sun</p>
<p>That a heavenly course hath run?</p>
<p>Have ye lived to see those eyes</p>
<p>Where the pride of beauty lies?</p>
<p>Have ye heard that heavenly voice</p>
<p>That may make Love's heart rejoice?</p>
<p>Have ye seen Aglaia, she</p>
<p>Whom the world may joy to see?</p>
<p>If ye have not seen all these,</p>
<p>Then ye do but labour leese;</p>
<p>While ye tune your pipes to play</p>
<p>But an idle roundelay;</p>
<p>And in sad Discomfort's den</p>
<p>Everyone go bite her pen;</p>
<p>That she cannot reach the skill</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page09" name="page09"></a>{09}</span>
<p>How to climb that blessed hill</p>
<p>Where Aglaia's fancies dwell,</p>
<p>Where exceedings do excell,</p>
<p>And in simple truth confess</p>
<p>She is that fair shepherdess</p>
<p>To whom fairest flocks a-field</p>
<p>Do their service duly yield:</p>
<p>On whom never Muse hath gaz&egrave;d</p>
<p>But in musing is amaz&egrave;d;</p>
<p>Where the honour is too much</p>
<p>For their highest thoughts to touch;</p>
<p>Thus confess, and get ye gone</p>
<p>To your places every one;</p>
<p>And in silence only speak</p>
<p>When ye find your speech too weak.</p>
<p>Bless&egrave;d be Aglaia yet,</p>
<p>Though the Muses die for it;</p>
<p>Come abroad, ye bless&egrave;d Muses,</p>
<p>Ye that Pallas chiefly chooses,</p>
<p>When she would command a creature</p>
<p>In the honour of Love's nature,</p>
<p>For the sweet Aglaia fair</p>
<p>All to sweeten all the air,</p>
<p>Is abroad this bless&egrave;d day;</p>
<p>Haste ye, therefore, come away:</p>
<p>And to kill Love's maladies</p>
<p>Meet her with your melodies.</p>
<p class="i2">  Flora hath been all about,</p>
<p>And hath brought her wardrobe out;</p>
<p>With her fairest, sweetest flowers,</p>
<p>All to trim up all your bowers.</p>
<p class="i2">Bid the shepherds and their swains</p>
<p>See the beauty of their plains;</p>
<p>And command them with their flocks</p>
<p>To do reverence on the rocks;</p>
<p>Where they may so happy be</p>
<p>As her shadow but to see:</p>
<p>Bid the birds in every bush</p>
<p>Not a bird to be at hush:</p>
<p>But to sit, and chirp, and sing</p>
<p>To the beauty of the Spring:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>{10}</span>
<p>Call the sylvan nymphs together,</p>
<p>Bid them bring their musicks hither.</p>
<p>Trees their barky silence break,</p>
<p>Crack yet, though they cannot speak</p>
<p>Bid the purest, whitest swan</p>
<p>Of her feathers make her fan;</p>
<p>Let the hound the hare go chase;</p>
<p>Lambs and rabbits run at base;</p>
<p>Flies be dancing in the sun,</p>
<p>While the silk-worm's webs are spun;</p>
<p>Hang a fish on every hook</p>
<p>As she goes along the brook;</p>
<p>So with all your sweetest powers</p>
<p>Entertain her in your bowers;</p>
<p>Where her ear may joy to hear</p>
<p>How ye make your sweetest quire;</p>
<p>And in all your sweetest vein</p>
<p>Still Aglaia strike her strain;</p>
<p>But when she her walk doth turn,</p>
<p>Then begin as fast to mourn;</p>
<p>All your flowers and garlands wither</p>
<p>Put up all your pipes together;</p>
<p>Never strike a pleasing strain</p>
<p>Till she come abroad again.</p>

		<p>In the merry month of May,</p>
		<p>In a morn by break of day,</p>
		<p>With a troop of damsels playing</p>

		<p>When anon by a woodside,</p>

		<p>Such as silly shepherds use</p>
		<p>When they will not love abuse;</p>
		<p>Love, which had been long deluded,</p>

	<p>Sweet Phyllis, if a silly swain</p>
	<p class="i2">May sue to thee for grace,</p>
	<p>See not thy loving shepherd slain</p>
	<p class="i2">With looking on thy face;</p>

	<p class="i2">Upon my flock and me;</p>
	<p>Thou seest they now regard me not,</p>
	<p class="i2">But all do follow thee.</p>

	<p class="i2">With prying in thine eyes,</p>
	<p>Yet let not comfort be consumed</p>
	<p class="i2">That in thy pity lies;</p>
	<p>But as thou art that Phyllis fair,</p>
	<p class="i2">That fortune favour gives,</p>
	<p>So let not love die in despair</p>
	<p class="i2">That in thy favour lives.</p>
	<p>The deer do browse upon the briar,</p>
	<p class="i2">The birds do pick the cherries;</p>

	<p class="i2">To cast a look on me.</p>
	<p>But if thy beauty make thee proud,</p>
	<p class="i2">Think then what is ordain'd;</p>
	<p>The heavens have never yet allow'd</p>

	<p>A silly shepherd lately sat</p>
	<p class="i2">Among a flock of sheep;</p>
	<p>Where musing long on this and that,</p>
	<p class="i2">At last he fell asleep.</p>
	<p>And in the slumber as he lay,</p>
	<p class="i2">He gave a piteous groan;</p>
	<p>He thought his sheep were run away,</p>
	<p class="i2">And he was left alone.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>{17}</span>
	<p>He whoop'd, he whistled, and he call'd,</p>
	<p class="i2">But not a sheep came near him;</p>
	<p>Which made the shepherd sore appall'd</p>
	<p class="i2">To see that none would hear him.</p>
	<p>But as the swain amaz&egrave;d stood,</p>
	<p class="i2">In this most solemn vein,</p>
	<p>Came Phyllida forth of the wood,</p>
	<p class="i2">And stood before the swain.</p>
	<p>Whom when the shepherd did behold</p>
	<p class="i2">He straight began to weep,</p>
	<p>And at the heart he grew a-cold,</p>
	<p class="i2">To think upon his sheep.</p>
	<p>For well he knew, where came the queen,</p>
	<p class="i2">The shepherd durst not stay:</p>
	<p>And where that he durst not be seen,</p>
	<p class="i2">The sheep must needs away.</p>
	<p>To ask her if she saw his flock,</p>
	<p class="i2">Might happen patience move,</p>
	<p>And have an answer with a mock,</p>
	<p class="i2">That such demanders prove.</p>
	<p>Yet for because he saw her come</p>
	<p class="i2">Alone out of the wood,</p>
	<p>He thought he would not stand as dumb,</p>
	<p class="i2">When speech might do him good;</p>
	<p>And therefore falling on his knees,</p>
	<p class="i2">To ask but for his sheep,</p>
	<p>He did awake, and so did leese</p>

	<p>Seest thou not, in clearest days,</p>
	<p>Oft thick fogs cloud Heaven's rays?</p>
	<p>And that vapours which do breathe</p>
	<p>From the Earth's gross womb beneath,</p>
	<p>Seem unto us with black steams</p>
	<p>To pollute the Sun's bright beams,</p>
	<p>And yet vanish into air,</p>
	<p>Leaving it unblemished fair?</p>
	<p>So, my Willy, shall it be</p>
	<p>With Detraction's breath on thee:</p>
	<p>It shall never rise so high</p>
	<p>As to stain thy poesy.</p>
	<p>As that sun doth oft exhale</p>
	<p>Vapours from each rotten vale,</p>
	<p>Poesy so sometime drains</p>
	<p>Gross conceits from muddy brains;</p>
	<p>Mists of envy, fogs of spite,</p>
	<p>Twixt men's judgments and her light;</p>
	<p>But so much her power may do,</p>
	<p>That she can dissolve them too.</p>
	<p>If thy verse do bravely tower,</p>
	<p>As she makes wing she gets power;</p>
	<p>Yet the higher she doth soar,</p>
	<p>She's affronted still the more,</p>
	<p>Till she to the highest hath past;</p>
	<p>Then she rests with Fame at last.</p>
	<p>Let nought, therefore, thee affright;</p>
	<p>But make forward in thy flight.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>{25}</span>
	<p>For if I could match thy rhyme,</p>
	<p>To the very stars I'd climb;</p>
	<p>There begin again, and fly</p>
	<p>Till I reached eternity.</p>
	<p>But, alas, my Muse is slow,</p>
	<p>For thy place she flags too low;</p>
	<p>Yea, the more's her hapless fate,</p>
	<p>Her short wings were clipt of late;</p>
	<p>And poor I, her fortune ruing,</p>
	<p>Am put up myself a mewing.</p>
	<p>But if I my cage can rid,</p>
	<p>I'll fly where I never did;</p>
	<p>And though for her sake I'm crost,</p>
	<p>Though my best hopes I have lost,</p>
	<p>And knew she would make my trouble</p>
	<p>Ten times more than ten times double,</p>
	<p>I should love and keep her too,</p>
	<p>Spite of all the world could do.</p>
	<p>For though, banished from my flocks</p>
	<p>And confined within these rocks,</p>
	<p>Here I waste away the light</p>
	<p>And consume the sullen night,</p>
	<p>She doth for my comfort stay,</p>
	<p>And keeps many cares away.</p>
	<p>Though I miss the flowery fields,</p>
	<p>With those sweets the spring-tide yields;</p>
	<p>Though I may not see those groves,</p>
	<p>Where the shepherds chaunt their loves,</p>
	<p>And the lasses more excel</p>
	<p>Than the sweet-voiced Philomel;</p>
	<p>Though of all those pleasures past,</p>
	<p>Nothing now remains at last</p>
	<p>But Remembrance--poor relief!</p>
	<p>That more makes than mends my grief:</p>
	<p>She's my mind's companion still,</p>
	<p>Maugre envy's evil will;</p>
	<p>Whence she should be driven too,</p>
	<p>Were't in mortal's power to do.</p>
	<p>She doth tell me where to borrow</p>
	<p>Comfort in the midst of sorrow,</p>
	<p>Makes the desolatest place</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>{26}</span>
	<p>To her presence be a grace,</p>
	<p>And the blackest discontents</p>
	<p>To be pleasing ornaments.</p>
	<p>In my former days of bliss</p>
	<p>Her divine skill taught me this,</p>
	<p>That from everything I saw</p>
	<p>I could some invention draw,</p>
	<p>And raise pleasure to her height</p>
	<p>Through the meanest object's sight;</p>
	<p>By the murmur of a spring,</p>
	<p>Or the least bough's rustling;</p>
	<p>By a daisy, whose leaves spread,</p>
	<p>Shut when Titan goes to bed;</p>
	<p>Or a shady bush or tree;</p>
	<p>She could more infuse in me,</p>
	<p>Than all Nature's beauties can</p>
	<p>In some other wiser man.</p>
	<p>By her help I also now</p>
	<p>Make this churlish place allow</p>
	<p>Some things that may sweeten gladness</p>
	<p>In the very gall of sadness:</p>
	<p>The dull loneness, the black shade</p>
	<p>That these hanging vaults have made;</p>
	<p>The strange music of the waves</p>
	<p>Beating on these hollow caves;</p>
	<p>This black den which rocks emboss</p>
	<p>Overgrown with eldest moss;</p>
	<p>The rude portals that give light</p>
	<p>More to terror than delight;</p>
	<p>This my chamber of neglect,</p>
	<p>Walled about with disrespect;</p>
	<p>From all these, and this dull air,</p>
	<p>A fit object for despair,</p>
	<p>She hath taught me, by her might,</p>
	<p>To draw comfort and delight.</p>
	<p>Therefore, thou best earthly bliss,</p>
	<p>I will cherish thee for this.</p>
	<p>Poesy, thou sweet'st content</p>
	<p>That e'er Heaven to mortals lent!</p>
	<p>Though they as a trifle leave thee</p>
	<p>Whose dull thoughts cannot conceive thee,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>{27}</span>
	<p>Though thou be to them a scorn</p>
	<p>That to nought but earth are born</p>
	<p>Let my life no longer be</p>
	<p>Than I am in love with thee.</p>
	<p>Though our wise ones call thee madness,</p>
	<p>Let me never taste of gladness,</p>
	<p>If I love not thy maddest fits</p>
	<p>More than all their greatest wits.</p>
	<p>And though some, too seeming holy,</p>
	<p>Do account thy raptures folly,</p>
	<p>Thou dost teach me to contemn</p>
	<p>What makes knaves and fools of them.</p>

<h3 id="gw02">A Poet's Home</h3>
<div class="poem">
	<p>Two pretty rills do meet, and meeting make</p>
	<p>Within one valley a large silver lake:</p>
	<p>About whose banks the fertile mountains stood</p>
	<p>In ages pass&egrave;d bravely crowned with wood,</p>
	<p>Which lending cold-sweet shadows gave it grace</p>
	<p>To be accounted Cynthia's bathing-place;</p>
	<p>And from her father Neptune's brackish court,</p>
	<p>Fair Thetis thither often would resort,</p>
	<p>Attended by the fishes of the sea,</p>
	<p>Which in those sweeter waters came to plea.</p>
	<p>There would the daughter of the Sea God dive,</p>
	<p>And thither came the Land Nymphs every eve</p>
	<p>To wait upon her: bringing for her brows</p>
	<p>Rich garlands of sweet flowers and beechy boughs.</p>
	<p>For pleasant was that pool, and near it then</p>
	<p>Was neither rotten marsh nor boggy fen,</p>
	<p>It was nor overgrown with boisterous sedge,</p>
	<p>Nor grew there rudely then along the edge</p>
	<p>A bending willow, nor a prickly bush,</p>
	<p>Nor broad-leaved flag, nor reed, nor knotty rush.</p>
	<p>But here well-ordered was a grove with bowers,</p>
	<p>There grassy plots set round about with flowers.</p>
	<p>Here you might through the water see the land</p>
	<p>Appear, strowed o'er with white or yellow sand;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>{28}</span>
	<p>Yon deeper was it, and the wind by whiffs</p>
	<p>Would make it rise and wash the little cliffs</p>
	<p>On which, oft pluming, sat unfrighted than</p>
	<p>The gaggling wild-goose and the snow-white swan,</p>
	<p>With all those flocks of fowls which to this day,</p>
	<p>Upon those quiet waters breed and play.</p>
	<p>For though those excellences wanting be</p>
	<p>Which once it had, it is the same that we</p>
	<p>By transposition name the Ford of Arle,</p>
	<p>And out of which, along a chalky marle,</p>
	<p>That river trills whose waters wash the fort</p>
	<p>In which brave Arthur kept his royal court.</p>
	<p>North-east, not far from this great pool, there lies</p>
	<p>A tract of beechy mountains, that arise,</p>
	<p>With leisurely ascending, to such height</p>
	<p>As from their tops the warlike Isle of Wight</p>
	<p>You in the ocean's bosom may espy,</p>
	<p>Though near two furlongs thence it lie.</p>
	<p>The pleasant way, as up those hills you climb,</p>
	<p>Is strew&egrave;d o'er with marjoram and thyme,</p>
	<p>Which grows unset. The hedgerows do not want</p>
	<p>The cowslip, violet, primrose, nor a plant</p>
	<p>That freshly scents: as birch, both green and tall;</p>
	<p>Low sallows, on whose blooming bees do fall;</p>
	<p>Fair woodbines, which about the hedges twine;</p>
	<p>Smooth privet, and the sharp-sweet eglantine,</p>
	<p>With many moe whose leaves and blossoms fair</p>
	<p>The earth adorn and oft perfume the air.</p>
<p class="caesura">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="i2">When you unto the highest do attain</p>
	<p>An intermixture both of wood and plain</p>
	<p>You shall behold, which, though aloft it lie,</p>
	<p>Hath downs for sheep and fields for husbandry,</p>
	<p>So much, at least, as little needeth more,</p>
	<p>If not enough to merchandise their store.</p>
<p class="caesura">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="i2">In every row hath nature planted there</p>
	<p>Some banquet for the hungry passenger.</p>
	<p>For here the hazel-nut and filbert grows,</p>
	<p>There bullice, and, a little farther, sloes.</p>
	<p>On this hand standeth a fair weilding-tree,</p>
	<p>On that large thickets of blackberries be.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>{29}</span>
	<p>The shrubby fields are raspice orchards there,</p>
	<p>The new felled woods like strawberry gardens are,</p>
	<p>And had the King of Rivers blessed those hills</p>
	<p>With some small number of such pretty rills</p>
	<p>As flow elsewhere, Arcadia had not seen</p>
	<p>A sweeter plot of earth than this had been.</p>

<h3 id="gw03">Her Beauty</h3>
<div class="poem">
	<p>Her true beauty leaves behind</p>
	<p>Apprehensions in my mind</p>
	<p>Of more sweetness than all art</p>
	<p>Or inventions can impart;</p>
	<p>Thoughts too deep to be expressed,</p>
	<p>And too strong to be suppressed....</p>
	<p>... What pearls, what rubies can</p>
	<p>Seem so lovely fair to man,</p>
	<p>As her lips whom he doth love</p>
	<p>When in sweet discourse they move:</p>
	<p>Or her lovelier teeth, the while</p>
	<p>She doth bless him with a smile!</p>
	<p>Stars indeed fair creatures be;</p>
	<p>Yet amongst us where is he</p>
	<p>Joys not more the whilst he lies</p>
	<p>Sunning in his mistress' eyes.</p>
	<p>Than in all the glimmering light</p>
	<p>Of a starry winter's night?</p>
	<p class="i2">Note the beauty of an eye,</p>
	<p>And if aught you praise it by</p>
	<p>Leave such passion in your mind,</p>
	<p>Let my reason's eye be blind.</p>
	<p>Mark if ever red or white</p>
	<p>Anywhere gave such delight</p>
	<p>As when they have taken place</p>
	<p>In a worthy woman's face.</p>

	<p>A handkerchief cast o'er and o'er again;</p>
	<p>And none returneth empty that hath spent</p>
	<p>His pains to fill their rural merriment.</p>

<h3 id="wb04">Birds in May</h3>
<div class="poem">
	<p>As (woo'd by May's delights) I have been borne</p>
	<p>To take the kind air of a wistful morn</p>
	<p>Near Tavy's voiceful stream (to whom I owe</p>
	<p>More strains than from my pipe can ever flow),</p>
	<p>Here have I heard a sweet bird never lin</p>
	<p>To chide the river for his clam'rous din;</p>
	<p>There seem'd another in his song to tell,</p>
	<p>That what the fair stream did he liked well;</p>
	<p>And going further heard another too,</p>
	<p>All varying still in what the others do;</p>
	<p>A little thence, a fourth with little pain</p>
	<p>Conn'd all their lessons, and them sung again;</p>
	<p>So numberless the songsters are that sing</p>
	<p>In the sweet groves of the too-careless spring,</p>
	<p>That I no sooner could the hearing lose</p>
	<p>Of one of them, but straight another rose,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>{47}</span>
	<p>And perching deftly on a quaking spray,</p>
	<p>Nigh tir'd herself to make her hearer stay.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>

<div class="poem">
	<p>As I have seen when on the breast of Thames</p>
	<p>A heavenly bevy of sweet English dames,</p>
	<p>In some calm ev'ning of delightful May,</p>
	<p>With music give a farewell to the day,</p>
	<p>Or as they would, with an admired tone,</p>
	<p>Greet Night's ascension to her ebon throne,</p>
	<p>Rapt with their melody a thousand more</p>

<h3 id="wb06">A Concert of Birds</h3>
<div class="poem">
	<p>The mounting lark (day's herald) got on wing,</p>
	<p>Bidding each bird choose out his bough and sing.</p>
	<p>The lofty treble sung the little wren;</p>
	<p>Robin the mean, that best of all loves men;</p>
	<p>The nightingale the tenor, and the thrush</p>
	<p>The counter-tenor sweetly in a bush.</p>
	<p>And that the music might be full in parts,</p>
	<p>Birds from the groves flew with right willing hearts;</p>
	<p>But (as it seem'd) they thought (as do the swains,</p>
	<p>Which tune their pipes on sack'd Hibernia's plains)</p>
	<p>There should some droning part be, therefore will'd</p>
	<p>Some bird to fly into a neighb'ring field,</p>
	<p>In embassy unto the King of Bees,</p>
	<p>To aid his partners on the flowers and trees</p>
	<p>Who, condescending, gladly flew along</p>
	<p>To bear the bass to his well-tuned song.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>{48}</span>
	<p>The crow was willing they should be beholding</p>
	<p>For his deep voice, but being hoarse with scolding,</p>
	<p>He thus lends aid; upon an oak doth climb,</p>
	<p>And nodding with his head, so keepeth time.</p>

	<p>Now great Hyperion left his golden throne</p>
	<p>That on the dancing waves in glory shone,</p>
	<p>For whose declining on the western shore</p>
	<p>The oriental hills black mantles wore,</p>
	<p>And thence apace the gentle twilight fled,</p>
	<p>That had from hideous caverns ushered</p>
	<p>All-drowsy Night, who in a car of jet,</p>
	<p>By steeds of iron-grey, which mainly sweat</p>
	<p>Moist drops on all the world, drawn through the sky,</p>
	<p>The helps of darkness waited orderly.</p>
	<p>First thick clouds rose from all the liquid plains;</p>
	<p>Then mists from marishes, and grounds whose veins</p>
	<p>Were conduit-pipes to many a crystal spring;</p>
	<p>From standing pools and fens were following</p>
	<p>Unhealthy fogs; each river, every rill</p>
	<p>Sent up their vapours to attend her will</p>
	<p>These pitchy curtains drew 'twixt earth and heaven</p>
	<p>And as Night's chariot through the air was driven,</p>

<div class="poem">
	<p>Unto a pleasant grove or such like place,</p>
	<p>Where here the curious cutting of a hedge:</p>
	<p>There, by a pond, the trimming of the sedge:</p>
	<p>Here the fine setting of well-shading trees:</p>
	<p>The walks there mounting up by small degrees,</p>
	<p>The gravel and the green so equal lie,</p>
	<p>It, with the rest, draws on your ling'ring eye:</p>
	<p>Here the sweet smells that do perfume the air,</p>
	<p>Arising from the infinite repair</p>
	<p>Of odoriferous buds and herbs of price,</p>
	<p>(As if it were another Paradise)</p>
	<p>So please the smelling sense, that you are fain</p>
	<p>Where last you walk'd to turn and walk again.</p>
	<p>There the small birds with their harmonious notes</p>
	<p>Sing to a spring that smileth as she floats:</p>
	<p>For in her face a many dimples show,</p>
	<p>And often skips as it did dancing go:</p>
	<p>Here further down an over-arched alley,</p>

	<p>You spy at end thereof a standing lake,</p>
	<p>Where some ingenious artist strives to make</p>
	<p>The water (brought in turning pipes of lead</p>
	<p>Through birds of earth most lively fashioned)</p>
	<p>To counterfeit and mock the sylvans all,</p>
	<p>In singing well their own set madrigal.</p>
	<p>This with no small delight retains your ear,</p>

	<p>Then in another place the fruits that be</p>
	<p>In gallant clusters decking each good tree,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>{51}</span>
	<p>Invite your hand to crop some from the stem,</p>
	<p>And liking one, taste every sort of them:</p>
	<p>Then to the arbours walk, then to the bowers,</p>
	<p>Thence to the walks again, thence to the flowers,</p>
	<p>Then to birds, and to the clear spring thence,</p>
	<p>Now pleasing one, and then another sense.</p>
	<p>Here one walks oft, and yet anew begin'th,</p>
	<p>As if it were some hidden labyrinth;</p>
	<p>So loath to part and so content to stay,</p>
	<p>That when the gard'ner knocks for you away,</p>
	<p>It grieves you so to leave the pleasures in it,</p>
	<p>That you could wish that you had never seen it.</p>

	<p>Here pulls his line, there throws it in again,</p>

	<p>At last a hungry pike, or well-grown bream</p>
	<p>Snatch at the worm, and hasting fast away,</p>
	<p>He knowing it a fish of stubborn sway,</p>
	<p>Pulls up his rod, but soft, as having skill,</p>
	<p>Wherewith the hook fast holds the fish's gill;</p>
	<p>Then all his line he freely yieldeth him,</p>

	<p>Th' insnared fish, here on the top doth scud,</p>
	<p>There underneath the banks, then in the mud,</p>
